# Dev Academy Points

## Overview

The **Dev Academy Points System** is a collaborative project designed to streamline the process of allocating points to students based on their contributions, achievements, and overall performance. This system provides a centralized platform for teachers to recognize and reward their students. This was a group prouject completed in 24 hours. My main contributions to this were the backend databases and linking this to the front end.
